Title: About Amara

[Amara][] gives individuals, communities, and larger organizations the power to
overcome accessibility and language barriers for online video. The tools are
free and open source and make the work of subtitling and translating video
simpler, more appealing, and, most of all, more collaborative.

Amara is composed of three main parts:

* A subtitle creation and viewing tool (aka the widget)
* A collaborative subtitling website
* An open protocol for subtitle search/delivery

The benefits of captioning and subtitling are immense:

* Captions make videos accessible for viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing.
* Translations make it possible for all of us to watch video in languages that
  we don't speak.
* Video creators get: better SEO, more views, access to a far bigger
  (potentially multilingual and global) audience, accessibility for deaf and
  hard of hearing viewers, and more.

Everything we do is available under the open source AGPL license.
